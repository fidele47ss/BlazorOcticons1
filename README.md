## Advanced Usage

### Custom SVG Icons

If you need to use custom SVG icons, you can create your own components by following this structure:

1. Create a new `.razor` file.
2. Use the `<svg>` tag to define your icon.
3. Make it customizable by accepting parameters for size and color.

### Example of Custom SVG Component

```razor
@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int Size { get; set; } = 24;

    [Parameter]
    public string Color { get; set; } = "black";
}

<svg width="@Size" height="@Size" fill="@Color" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <!-- Your SVG path here -->
